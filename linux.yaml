INTRODUCTION TO LINUX AND SCRIPTING: 
====================================

1. Linux is a free open-source operating system. It was first released by Linus Torvalds in 1991
2. One of Linux's core components is the Linux kernel, which handles process control, 
   networking, access to peripherals, and file system management.

LINUX DISTRIBUTION:
  Popular Distributions:

Ubuntu: Known for its user-friendliness and active community.
Fedora: Features cutting-edge software and innovations.
Debian: Praised for its stability and reliability.
Arch Linux: Aimed at experienced users who want to customize their OS.
CentOS: Preferred in enterprise environments for its stability and long-term support.

LINUX Architectiure:
- Linux kernel: The core of the Linux system.
- system libraries: Interface between the kernel and applications.
- system Utilities: Programs that perform individual, specialized management tasks.
- applications: Various software to perform work or provide services.  

the windows filesystem:
  C:\
  C:\Users\forch
  /= the root directory

The Linux File system:
The Linux filesystem is a hierarchical structure where all files and directories are located under the root directory
denoted by "/". This structure allows for efficient file storage, management, and access. 

Key directories include

/                      # The root directory
├── bin/               # Essential user command binaries
├── etc/               # System configuration files
├── home/              # This is where users are created
│   ├── user1/
│   └── usern/
├── opt/               # Optional add-on applications
├── lib/               # Essential shared libraries and kernel modules

├── var/
│   ├── log/           # Log files
│   └── mail/          # Mail server files
├── proc/              # Process information pseudo-filesystem
└── usr/
    ├── bin/           # User binaries
    ├── lib/           # Libraries for the binaries in /usr/bin/
    ├── local/
    │   ├── bin/       # Local binaries
    │   └── lib/       # Local libraries
    └── share/         # Architecture-independent data

Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Explanation:

/bin: - Essential User Binaries:
The /bin directory contains essential user command binaries that are necessary for basic system operations. 
These are commands that the system administrator and users use for troubleshooting, repairing, and system maintenance purposes.

/etc - Configuration Files:
/etc houses configuration files required by all programs. This includes system initialization scripts, 
network configurations, and service configuration files. It is the go-to place for system-wide configuration.

/home - User Home Directories:
Each user on the system is assigned a specific directory under /home. This directory is intended for 
storing personal files, configurations, and is the default working directory when a user logs in.

/opt - Optional Add-on Applications:
/opt is reserved for the installation of add-on application software packages. These are applications 
that are not part of the default installation and usually come from third-party vendors.

/tmp - Temporary Files:
The /tmp directory is used to store temporary files used by applications and the system. Files in this 
directory may be deleted without notice, such as on system reboot.

/usr - User Binaries and Read-only Data:
/usr is one of the largest directories on the system, containing user binaries, their documentation, l
ibraries, header files, and static data. 
The structure of /usr can be further divided into:

/usr/bin - User commands and binary files.
/usr/lib - Libraries for the binaries in /usr/bin.
/usr/local - Tertiary hierarchy for local data, specific to the host.
/usr/share - Architecture-independent (shared) data.
/var - Variable Files
/var contains variable data files. This includes spool directories and files, administrative and logging data, 
and transient and temporary files.

COMMANDS:
  users interact with the linux OS using commands
  windows has a cli and gui
  these commands and performed on the command line interface (CLI) 



to get into the Linux OS 
this is to securely connect to the OS through ssh on port 22

- You need an ssh client like:
  - gitbash
  - powershell
  - commandprompt
  - vscode  (integrated development envrironment)
  - terminal
  - PuTTY
  - MobaExterm
   
- you need to create a server in AWS(Azure, Alibaba, Google-Cloud)/VMWare/WSL/VirtualBox/
- get the private key
- public ipv4 address
- the username

what is the ssh command?

ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@18.212.221.136

1. File Manangement Commands:
2. User Manangement Commands:
3. process Manangement Commands:
4. Package Manangement Commands:



5. Navigation Manangement Commands:
  =================================

  these are command that help tyhe user to be able to navigate between directories, files, editor

whwenever you connect to yoiur system there is a default user called ec2-user.
there is another user which is the system user called the root user

the root user has all the admin permissions
the ec2-user has delegated admin permissions

sudo echo "ec2-user  ALL=(ALL)    ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
